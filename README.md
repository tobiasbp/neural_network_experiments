# Neural network experiments
A few simple experiments with neural networks (NN) in PyTorch.

# Run the examples
Descriptions of the examples in this repository.
## _binary_double.py_
A single layer neural network that learns to double integers (bit shift left).

# How to set up the virtual environment
Go to the root of the repository, and run these commands: 
1. Setup a virtual Python environment in the _.venv_ dir: `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   * Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
   * Windows: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies: `pip3 intstall -r requirements.txt`
4. Run a file: `python some_file.py`
5. When done, leave the virtual environment: `deactivate`
